    <p>This paragraph was a waste of time and space.
       If you had not read this and I had not typed this you and I could’ve done something more
        productive than reading this mindlessly and carelessly as if y
        ou did not have anything else to do in life. Li
        fe is so precious <spam class="emp">because it is short and you are being so careless
         that you do not realize it until </spam>now since this void paragraph mentions that you 
         are doing something so mindless, so stupid, so careless that you rea
         lize that you are not using your time wisely. You could’ve been playing with your dog, or eating your cat, but no. You want to read this barren paragraph and expect something marvelous and terrific at the end. But since you still do not realize that you are wasting precious time, you still continue to read the null paragraph. If you had not noticed, you have wasted an estimated time of 20 seconds. Imagine what you could’ve done with those 20 seconds besides reading this non-productive paragraph. Imagine the things you could’ve accomplished. Imagine the possibilities. But time is irreversible and you still do not realize this. Somehow you have managed still to waste around now 35 seconds reading this stupid, excessive, and long paragraph with your irreversible time.</p>
